#### Contributing to this Documentation

Start by [creating a new post](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) one of the categories listed in `_config.yml`. It will appear in the navigation on the left once recompiled. Or use the supplied script to make creating pages easier:

```bash
ruby bin/jekyll-page "Example Page" doc
```

Then add your own content to this page (i.e. `example-page.md`) and change the `title` accordingly.
